# STUDENT-PORTAL-CLONE
Welcome to my HTML and CSS practice repository! This project is dedicated to refining my front-end development skills through focused exercises in HTML and CSS. It serves as a playground for honing fundamental concepts and enhancing my ability to create stylish and well-structured web pages.

Within this repository, you'll find a series of structured practice exercises designed to reinforce basic HTML and CSS elements. Dive into the code to explore the implementation of common UI components, styled using straightforward CSS techniques. While this repository doesn't focus on responsive design, it provides a solid foundation for mastering the essentials of front-end development.

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate through the directories to explore different practice exercises. Feel free to experiment with the code variations to solidify your understanding. Contributions are welcome! If you encounter a bug or have suggestions for enhancements, please open an issue. To contribute, fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request.
